# TabSwitcher 

TabSwitcher is my little experiment in building a Command-T like
extension for Chrome, through a plugin.

It's mostly crappy code at this state :] !

## What works 

- Triggering it with Control-\ 
- Jumping to the best match with Enter

## TODO

- Bind ESC to hide the UI
- Get a decent fuzzy matcher algorithm
- Get a shiny CSS 
- Go to any match by clicking on it or navigating with arrows ( or ctrl-j / ctrl-k ? )
- Get a config page to select an hotkey
